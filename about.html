          <p>Hi there! I'm Reece Kenney from Rugby, England. I currently work as a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I have many years experience creating software, mobile apps and websites for both myself, and for clients. I have experience programming in many different languages such as C, C++, C#, Java, PHP and Objective-C, however some of my favourite projects involve working in Swift for iOS.</p>
          <p>I graduated from university in Leeds, England with first class honours (4.0 GPA) in Computer Science and also spent a year studying computer science at Purdue University in Indiana, USA. </p>
